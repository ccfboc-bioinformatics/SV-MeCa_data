# Benchmark Callsets

This directory contains the callsets employed to assess the performance metrics of the standalone SV callers BreakDancer, Delly, INSurVeyor, LUMPY, Manta, Pindel, and TARDIS.
To reproduce the results reported in the publication, a script is provided and can be executed as follows:  

```bash
python truvari_bench_metrics.py hg0002
```
In this example, `hg002` refers to the directory containing the decompressed VCF files generated by the `truvari bench` command:

* `tp-comp.vcf`: True Positive (TP) calls from the **comparison** set
* `fp.vcf`: False Positive (FP) calls from the **comparison** set
* `tp-base.vcf`: True Positive (TP) calls from the **benchmark** set
* `fn.vcf`: False Negative (FN) calls from the **benchmark** set
